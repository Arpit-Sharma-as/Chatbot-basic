How to Use

The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined rules.
The chatbot_response function checks user inputs against the predefined rules and returns an appropriate response.
You can customize the rules and responses in the chatbot.py file to expand the chatbot's capabilities and tailor its responses to your needs.


Customizing the Chatbot
You can customize the chatbot by editing the rules dictionary in the chatbot.py file. Add new rules and responses to enhance the chatbot's conversational abilities and make it more engaging.
